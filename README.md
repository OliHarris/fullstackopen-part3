Combined notes and exercises for https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3

Basically has two projects:

- notes <-- tutorial
- phonebook <-- exercise (hosted)

## Available Scripts 1

In each root 'client' directory you can run:

### `npm install`

Will perform a usual installation of any dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

Will perform a usual launch of the dev environment.

### `npm run build`

Will perform a usual build of minified files ready to be deployed.

## Available Scripts 2

In each root 'rest-api' directory you can run:

### `npm install`

Will perform a usual installation of any dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

Will perform a usual launch of the Node / Express environment.

## Note 1:

Each root 'client' directory was initially copied over from my work for part2 [here](https://github.com/OliHarris/fullstackopen-part2).

You can run 'npm run build'; the generated 'dist' folder then you can add to the 'rest-api' directory.

## NOTE 2:

As this is a Vite app, I hosted it on GitHub pages using this guide:
